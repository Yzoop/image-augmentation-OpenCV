FEATURES:

1. NAME: Resize.

   FORMAT: RESIZE (YOUR INT WIDTH),(YOUR INT HEIGHT)
   
   DESCRIPTION: resizes all images in the given folder (folders)
   by some value.

2. NAME: To gray scale.
   
   FORMAT: GRAY_SCALE (1 or 0)

   DESCRIPTION: changes colored (or already gray images) into gray
   scale. P.S. Stanandard scale formula:
   G = (0.3 * R) + (0.59 * G) + (0.11 * B), where G - final gray value
   of a pixel; R - red value of a pixel, G - green value of a pixel,
   B - blue value of a pixel

   VALUE: 1 if change to grayscale, 0 do not (also you may delete this command)




3. NAME: Noise.
   
   FORMAT: NOISE (A NOISE FLOAT VALUE)

   DESCRIPTION: adds points to random positions (simply) noise 
   to image.

   VALUE: must be more than 0




4. NAME: Rotation transforms
   
   FORMAT: ROTATION (A ROTATION VALUE IN DEGREE)

   DESCRIPTION: randomly rotates an images by given value in DEG
   VALUES: from 0 to 360




5. NAME: Brightness
   
   FORMAT: BRIGHTNESS (A NUMBER)

   DESCRIPTION: randomly changes brightess of images, by adding a random value
